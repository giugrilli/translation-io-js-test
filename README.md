## Helpful Projects

- [`translation-gem`](https://github.com/aurels/translation-gem) is the Ruby
  version of this project, and is the official implementation.  If you need a
  guarantee that the API won't change and it will maintain support with the
  service, I'd recommend that. This project is specifically for projects that
  don't have a Ruby on Rails dependency and don't want to add one. Special
  thanks goes to @MichaelHoste for his advice on this implementation.
